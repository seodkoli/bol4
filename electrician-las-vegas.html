Las Vegas is an internationally prominent significant resort city, known largely for its betting, purchasing, fine eating, amusement, and nightlife, with a lot of locations centered on downtown Las Las vega and even more to the Las Vegas Strip just outside city restrictions. The Las Las Vega Valley in its entirety acts as the leading economic, commercial, and cultural facility for Nevada. According to the USA Census Bureau, the city had 641,903 locals in 2020, with an urbane population of 2,227,053, making it the 25th-most heavily populated city in the United States.
